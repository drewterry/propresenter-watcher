# TODO

- UI: Add/Remove modules from the frontend

- UI: Allow end user to edit custom triggers by associating a ProPresenter event / note tag with an arbitrary HTTP/TCP/WebSocket call

- UI: have each controller module expose an "arbitrary" command that can take an arbitrary string and send it to the app it controls

- UI: build an electron wrapper around the app
