# TODO

- UI: Add/Remove/Configure modules from the frontend

- UI: Allow end user to edit custom triggers by associating a ProPresenter event / note tag with an arbitrary HTTP/TCP/WebSocket call

- UI: have each controller module expose an "arbitrary" command that can take an arbitrary string and send it to the app it controls

- UI: Allow end user to edit custom triggers for each module by linking javascript code to global ProPresenter events like timer updates.

- BACKEND: ensure that custom triggers get added to the config file.

- UI: add documentation about the config file and the advanced triggers.

- UI: build an electron wrapper around the app
